                <p>Good day!<br><br>

		Please see attached nomination for BCQ declaration for delivery date <b><u>{DATE}</b></u>.
		
		<br><br>Kindly acknowledge upon receipt.

                <br><br>Note:

                <br><br>Due to the imposition of the Enhanced Community Quarantine throughout Luzon last March 17, 2020, ACEI RES's contestable customers have been physically and legally unable to operate and receive electricity from {{Sup}}. In view thereof, ACEI invokes Force Majeure beginning 12AM of 17 March 2020 until such time that the national government has lifted the Enhanced Community Quarantine and our contestable customers are not anymore legally prohibited or barred from operating.

                <br><br>In order to have equitable allocation during this Force Majeure Event, we are proposing the following methodology to determine the appropriate hourly Contract Capacities.</p>
		
		<br><br><p style="text-indent: 40px"><b>A_CC_FM = CC * Daily MQ / Reference MQ</b></p><br><br>
 
		<ol type="a">
		<li>A_CC_FM = Adjusted Contract Capacity due to Force Majeure</li>
		<li>CC = Contract Capacity</li>
		<li>Daily MQ = MQ of ACEI RES
		<br>This is the total consumption of all customers of ACEI RES. The daily MQ will be initially used during the daily nomination of BCQs and should the daily MQs contain errors, ACEI shall use its best estimate to determine the Daily MQs. This will eventually be adjusted when the Final Settlement Data from IEMOP becomes available.</li>
		<li>Reference MQ = Average of MQ of ACEI RES, prior the Enhanced Community Quarantine, for the same trading interval, same day, for the past 4 weeks.
		<br>In the interim, ACEI will be using the FEB 2020 MQs (or estimate for newly switched customers due to availability of data) since some MQs contain errors during this March billing. This will eventually be adjusted when the Final Settlement Data from IEMOP becomes available.</li>
		<li>To have apples to apples comparison, we will be filtering out the effect of customers terminating from the corresponding Daily MQ and Reference MQ variables. This is to address the effect of  having these customers in the Reference MQ but not included in the Daily MQ. For customers who recently switched to ACEI RES, we will be securing historical data pertaining to the same time horizon with the Reference MQ and include it in the computation of the Reference MQ.</li>
		</ol>
 
		<p>Thank you.</p>
