# Heat Dash-PH

## __Introduction__
This project is created as a requirement for [CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science](https://https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) as the Final Project.

This roject extracts raw data from OpenWeatherMap through API requests and store the processed data in a local SQLite3 database every hour. The data collected will then be used to make a simple Web application interactive dashboard to analyze the temperature of all the cities in the philippines

__This Project features:__
* API Request Automation
* Data Extraction
* Data Transformation
* Data Loading
* Web App User Creation
* Web App User Authentication
* Data Visualization

## __Dependencies__

1. __API KEY__
    * OpenWeatherMap API Key
        Go to https://openweathermap.org/ and create a free account to have an API Key. 

2. __Requirements Text File with the needed names of pip installable libraries__
    * [__cs50__](https://pypi.org/project/cs50/)
    * [__pandas__](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
    * [__streamlit__](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/)
    * [__streamlit-lottie__](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-lottie/)
    * [__streamlit-option-menu__](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-option-menu/)
    * [__folium__](https://pypi.org/project/folium/)
    * [__streamlit-folium__](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-folium/)

    CS50 will be for using SQLite3 to store user credentials, and processed extracted data.

    Pandas will be used to read the data from SQLite3 Database into a Pandas' DataFrame.

    Streamlit will be used tho create/host the web application dashboard

    Streamlit-Lottie is for rendering GIFs/Animated images into the web app

    Streamlit-option-menu is used to have option menu in the dashboard

    Folium is for generating Map Object with the processed extracted data from SQLite3 database

    Streamlit-folium is for rendering the generated map object into the web app


3. __Style.css File__

    The css stylesheet is used for customizing some elements generated by Streamlit.
    Some changes are for borders, font size, font styles, font colors, width, and background color.

3. __Web.db file__

    The web.db file is used to store the data inserted to local SQLite3 Database. It contains the users' credentials such as username and password, and the processed data which will be in a structured form and with the following columns:

    * city
    * humidity
    * weather
    * description
    * temp_min
    * temp_max
    * lat
    * lon
    * date
    * hour 

## Work Flow

Upon running the web application using "streamlit run filename.py", it will automatically open a terminal window that will run the extract.py or the python script for extracting data from OpenWeatherMap through API requests, process the response collected to be on a structured format, and corrected data types, save the data to SQLite3 database.

Then the user can then use the web app simultaneously.

In the web-app login page, there will be users authentication that will occur once the users logs in. Some error handling are in place, such as:

    * User didn't enter a username
    * User didn't enter a password
    * User entered a non existing username
    * User entered wrong password

The web-app also has registration page that will ask for username, password and confirmation of the password. Some error handling are in place as well such as:

    * User didn't enter a username
    * User didn't enter a password
    * User didn't enter a password confirmation
    * User entered mismatched password and password confirmation
    * User entered a username that already exists

Once logged in, the user can now interact with the dashboard. The user can set the filters that will automatically updates the dataset used. The filters are only for columns "date" and "hour".

Once done, the user can now logout of the dashboard and will be back to the login page again.
